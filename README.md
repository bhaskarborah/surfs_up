#   Surfs Up-Analysis

## Overview of Project

This objective of this project is to find the feasibility of opening up a Surf n Shake shop in Oahu. 
This idea of opening up a Surf n Shake table already has the backing of an investor W. Avy. However, he has a concern regarding the weather, and how it would impact the feasibility of opening up the shop.
We need to run weather analysis on a set of data provided by W. Avy to ascertain that weather would not play a spoilt sport on the economics of opening up the shop.

## Purpose


The weather data to run our analysis on in present in the SQLite file:
hawaii.sqlite

The purpose of this project is to provide the below deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

We have to analyze the weather trends for June and December to provide an year around analysis of feasibility and sustainability of opening the Surf n Shake shop in Oahu. This data would be presented by W. Avy to further investors to collect  funding for the shop.

## Results

The maximum temperature of June is 85 Degree Farenheit, whereas the maximum temperature of December is 83 Degree Farenheit. Hence the maximum temperature does not fluctuate much from June to December.

The minimum temperature of June is 64 Degree Farenheit, whereas the maximum temperature of December is 56 Degree Farenheit. Although we 
notice a fluctuation of the minimum temperatures, this is still not that drastic and should not impact the overall feasibility of setting up the shop.

The average temperature of June is 75 Degree Farenheit and of Deecember is 71 degree Farenheit.

50% of the days in June have temperature more than 75 DegreeF and 50% of the days in December have temperature more than 71 DegreeF.

Hence from this analysis, the weather looks feasible to set up the Surf n Shake shop in Oahu.
